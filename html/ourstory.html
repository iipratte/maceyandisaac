			<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<hr />

			<p>
				Our story began at freshman orientation at Brigham Young University in 2023. We met by chance at the freshman “Y” picture event. Since that day, we
				saw each other at many other activities and began getting to know each other.
			</p>

			<p>
				Over time, our friendship grew into a relationship. From late-night study sessions to spontaneous Luchador events, we discovered how natural it felt
				to be together. Macey’s mom said she could kiss one boy a week—but she didn’t know it’d be the same boy :)
			</p>

			<p>Two years later, we got engaged surrounded by the mountains at Sundance. It was simple, sweet, and absolutely perfect.</p>

			<p>Since September 30, 2023, we’ve shared countless memories, laughter, and adventures—and we can’t wait to begin this next chapter together.</p>
